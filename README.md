# The Odin Project - Library App Project (7)

This is the first of twelve projects included in the JavaScript Course, third within the full-stack JS developer path. 
It requests the creation of a library application that allows adding new books to it, viewing all available books and being able to delete them. 
The use of any database is not contemplated, so the data is managed using arrays with JS.
For the graphic interface we use HTML and CSS, applying responsive design on this occasion and using some images to make it a little more striking. Thanks to the creators of these articles (correctly cited within the app).

I hope you like my work :)

Tools: HTML / CSS / JS
